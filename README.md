## 🛠 Skills 

#### Teamwork and collaboration
- Office 365 Champion for migration from Google to Microsoft. Helped document and create training material for colleagues in preparation for the migration. Helped colleagues with any issues once migration was completed.
- Encouraged knowledge sharing and in-house training sessions to build team members abilities. Ranged from small workshops on SQL querying to general support processes.
- Mentored more junior colleagues, providing technical assistance or guidance when solving issues.

#### Fast learner, effective timekeeping skills, and experienced project management
- Built a full stack application using the MERN stack a few days after graduating from Makers Academy. Before the 12 week bootcamp I had no prior experience of JavaScript or React.
- Balanced working a full time job, an intensive 12 week bootcamp and studied for my degree in Computing and IT that I'm currently doing with the Open University.
- Led standups and retros, utilising agile methods and practices to help build and deploy an MVP. Iterating on this with new features and fixing bugs. Encouraged colleagues to use JIRA for effecting sprint and ticketing management.

#### Analytical thinker and problem solver
- Removed blocker during Makers group project. Unable to get previous code from project before to work when creating new project. Organised a solution around using customer hooks and context in React.
- Saw business requirement for reporting on support statistics. Created SQL queries to gather this data and present it to management. They were then able to use CRM tools to use this data for reporting.
- Peer reviewed fellow students code during modules on Python. Suggested the use of recursion and gave example of how this would work for their program.
